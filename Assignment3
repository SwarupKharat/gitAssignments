Version control systems like Git are essential in collaborative projects as they allow multiple team members to work on the same codebase without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. Features like branches, commits, and merge tools facilitate parallel development, tracking of changes, and resolution of conflicts. GitHub further enhances collaboration by enabling pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.
